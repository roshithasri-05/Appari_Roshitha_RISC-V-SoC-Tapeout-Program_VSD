## 🧠 About the Program

Welcome to my personal documentation of the **RISC-V SoC Design & Tapeout Program** powered by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**. This is a step-by-step exploration of building a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** using a complete **RTL to GDSII** open-source toolchain.

> **"Learn by doing – from Verilog RTL to physical layout and tapeout-ready silicon!"**

## 📍 Program Milestone

```
🧾 RTL Design → 🔧 Logic Synthesis → 🏭 Physical Layout → 🔒 Tapeout Ready
```

## 📅 Week 0 – Setup & Toolchain Initialization

<summary><strong>🛠️ Initial Setup: Environment + Toolchain Install</strong></summary>

This foundational week was focused on preparing the system with essential tools for ASIC design workflows using open-source platforms.

| 📊 **GTKWave**        | Waveform viewer              | ✅ Installed & Working |


---

### 🔍 Learning Objectives

* Set up a complete **open-source digital design toolchain**
* Understood the **role of each tool** in the VLSI flow
* Gained hands-on with **simulators, synthesizers, layout, and waveform tools**
* Verified each tool to ensure readiness for RTL to GDSII transition

## 📌 System Configuration

To ensure smooth performance of all tools, I used the following environment:

| Component | Specification           |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| OS        | Ubuntu 20.04 LTS        |
| CPU       | 4 vCPU                  |
| RAM       | 6 GB                    |
| Storage   | 50 GB (Free Disk Space) |
